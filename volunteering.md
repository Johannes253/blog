title: How volunteering can help you and others
---

Have thought about volunteering? Why? Why not? Volunteering is a great way to help other people, get to know other people, be with them, make new friends, and maybe change the world a bit for the better, even if it's only for the one person you gave soup to in the soupkitchen. How can this help you, you may now ask? Great question, beside all the obvious benefits, of friends and activities and such, the human being is essentially a social being, so you can improve you mental health tremendously by volunteering. I myself am a firefighter and a paramedic, and some of my colluages(friends now) have had mental health problems, but now they feel like they do good in the world which helps them.
