title: "My experience with Jekyll-Styling"
author: Johannes Mayrhofer
---

Before this assigment i didn't know anything about jekyll, so i had a look at this  [tutorial](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/living-style-guide/) to get a bit inspiered, for any questions on syntax i just looked at the official [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). I honestly believe that the outcome is one i can be satisfied with, and i really like the progress i have made during this homework. I did struggle a bit with the styling of my page, since i am an uncreative person and i tend to just overdo it. But since we already had a css homework that was no big technical problem.

I am really looking forward to getting back into Javascript in the next homework, i have a little experience in using that, not professionally just for fun and school, but it was so long ago that I probably forgot most of it. 

Below you can see my blog before and after i restyled it.
