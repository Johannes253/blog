title: "Razor Pages with multiple Models"

This was my second time working with Razor Pages, it was a bit easier this time. I breezed through the first part, but I appearently moved my Models folder outside the project, making me unable to start the project again. After deliberation with Dr. Goadrich and moving the folder back it worked again. The second hurdle I fell over was that it said in the code Student instead of Students, one of my teammates helped me there and this issue was resolved in the span of 1 minute. This was the last problem for this project. Luckily I have quite the extensive experience working with C#, Models and Databases, so it was more of a refreshment then learning something new. 

Since I have volunteered to set up the Razor Pages for my team, the Falkner County Juvenile Court, I paid very close attention to this tutorial and feeling prepared to set it up for my team. But the biggest issue is going to be to get this to work on all 4 of our computers since 2 teammembers have MACs instead of Windows PCs. Pretty sure we can knock that out of the park though.
