title: "Relationship Modeling"
author: Johannes Mayrhofer

While i have worked as a Software Design Engineer for Process Control Systems I had to work a lot with databases, mostly MySQL from Microsoft, but due to certain circumstances i grew to be the resident expert on Oracle databases as well. The only thing that I have never done before is making a relationship diagram and a database model. It took me quite a while to figure out how to split up everything so that it makes sense. After asking Professor Goadrich I am now pretty satiesfied with how things turned out. I turned out to be really straitforward, the only thing where I feel the need to justify myself is the quantity using double instead of integer, if someone orders 2.5 loafs of bread. Asking some of the other students they would have gone with integer but see why i wouldn't. After all it was really interesting doing that and really creating a database from  "scratch" how it is suppossed to be done and not how I did it at work to save as much time as possible. When I go back to working I will definitely adopt this way of designing databases, since it makes it way easier to actually design it, and for the customer to get what they want. Below you can see my relationship diagram and my Database schema.
