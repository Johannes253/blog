title: "Moqups"

Our client isn't really sure what they want, but since we have weekly meetings, we agreed on a lot of stuff very quickly. I personally have never used Moqups in my professional carreer, but I see the reason why, and it certainly helps in visualizing all of that.

I think I was an integral part of the creation of the Moqups since I was the only one of my teammembers who had any experience with big projects with multiple people involved, so I was the guy who said what was probably possible in the given timeframe and what was to be a goal further out. Also since I was the one assigned to client communication I had the best idea of what they wanted, since I got to formulate the questions which makes the answer easiert to understand. 

I am futher going to assist my team by communicating with our client and I am alos going to continue providing my professional experience. We have further decided that I am the one who has to set up the Razor Pages, Identity and the logic for the download of the database into an Excel file.
