Since my last blog post, my role in the team has evolved, me being the one to set up the Github repository I am project lead on our database. Furthermore I held a little tutorial session using Github pull requests, so this is now a thing we regularly used which I am a bit proud of to be honest. Also i have introduced that we have to review each others code to make sure that it runs on all of our computers. 

Going into the second client meeting I had 35 hours, because I set up the Razor Pages + Identity, the Github repository and I handled all the client communication. I also was the first point of contact of my team if they had any problems, to figure something out. The second client meeting was very fast, it only took around 10 minutes, since I had asked everyone in the week before the meeting if they had any question, making sure that we can phrase them as clearly as possible. All of our questions got answered in record time and we were out there in record time. I was also the one who talked the most during the client meeting, owing to the fact that I got assigned the client communication role. 

Going ahead I am planning on programming the logic behind the downloading of the database, reviewing code, handling the client communication, helping my teammates if they have any questions.
