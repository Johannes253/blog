Since we have to host our website on the internet, this is a crucial homework to get right for the final project. Because of that all of our team worked together on this project, and whenever Hayden hit a roadblock all of us were on top of the poblem.

Personally, and I all of us thought that the connection strings were rather difficult since they didn't work like they are supposed to. The easiest part was the creation of the app server in Azure, which was pretty straight forward and worked the first time.

Since we thought it wouldn't be necessary to have multiple people add commits to the github on this project, as to not get into each others ways, and maybe not knowing what caused the error because of conflicts, we decided we are going to do it all on Hayden's notebook. This worked quite well, as we only did stuff when we had time in class or when we were having our weekly teammeeting. We finished with blazing glory and all of us are very confident that we can deploy the Faulkner County Project very well. https://github.com/HaydenMoussa/csci340lab10
